    "## Using the Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the No Free Lunch Theorem, we should know that sometimes, we do not know the best method to use a-priori. However, a general rule of thumb is that the Genetic Algorithm is useful for problems where we have few feasible design points where the feasible region is scattered about the domain of our cost or objective function. An example of such a problem is the 0/1 Knapsack problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the 0/1 Knapsack problem we envision a thief breaking into a musuem to steal artifacts. They are wearing a single knapsack that they plan to use to carry out of all of the artifacts they are attempting to steal. They know the value of each artifact in the musuem, and want to steal the most profitable combination of artifacts that they can fit into their knapsack. While this may seem a sort of sordid problem, the general mathematical formulation of the 0/1 Knapasck problem is applicable to many different types of problems. As it turns out the 0/1 Knapsack problem is NP Complete - meaning it is among the hardest problems in the computational class NP. There exists a psuedopolynomial time dynamic programming algorithm to solve it, and several greedy approximation strategies, but today we will see how the genetic algorithm can help us solve it"

We have a knapsack of capacity $C \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. For item $i$, we encode the decision to take it in $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ which is a component of a vector $x$.
